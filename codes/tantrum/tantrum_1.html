    <p style="color: #00FF9B">HEAR THIS, CIPHER! THIS MOMENT IS A NEXUS EVENT, AN INFRACTION POINT BETWEEN ALL TIMELINES. YOU MUST CHOOSE TO TURN BACK NOW. IN EVERY REALITY, YOUR COLLISION WITH EARTH CAUSES CHAOS AND DESTRUCTION ON AN UNFATHOMABLE SCALE!</p>
    <p style="color: #FFDA0F">OH NO! NOT CHAOS! I HATE THAT! LOOK NICK JR, I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT THIS PLANET IS GOING TO SELF-DESTRUCT EVENTUALLY, SO IT MIGHT AS WELL DO IT WITH ME AS BOSS, RIGHT? HOWSABOUT WE DIVVY THIS REALITY UP? I‚ÄôLL TAKE EARTH, YOU CAN TAKE ALL THE GAS GIANTS, AND I THROW IN THIS BLANKY.</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B">A SEDUCTIVE GAMBIT. BUT FOR THE SAKE OF TIME, I MUST RELENT.</p>
    <p style="color: #FFDA0F">WHAT DO YOU WANT? SODA? I CAN GET YOU SODA. EVEN IF YOUR MOM SAYS YOU‚ÄôRE NOT SUPPOSED TO DRINK IT, I CAN GET IT.</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B">I WAS NOT BORN YESTERDAY</p>
    <p style="color: #FFDA0F">OH HERE WE GO</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B">I WAS FORGED IN THE CRUCIBLE OF REALITY ITSELF, THE LAST SURVIVOR OF THE WAR OF THE TIME GIANTS. MY CELESTIAL CREATORS, GRANDFATHER AND GRANDMOTHER CLOCK, GIFTED ME WITH THE BURDEN OF PROTECTING THE TIMELINE FROM THOSE WHO WOULD DARE UNWEAVE IT.</p>
    <p style="color: #FFDA0F; margin-top: 1rem">AWW LOOK AT THAT! YOU SPOKE WITHOUT SPITTING UP ON YOURSELF! LOOK SIPPY CUP, IF YOU‚ÄôRE SAYING REALITY ISNT BIG ENOUGH FOR THE TWO OF US, I AGREE! YOU MIGHT WANNA PUT ON A SAFETY HELMET BECAUSE IM ABOUT TO FIND OUT HOW SOFT BABY SKULLS REALLY ARE.</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B; margin-top: 1rem">A FOOLISH STATEMENT. I CANNOT BE KILLED.</p>
    <p style="color: #FFDA0F">WANNA BET?</p>
    <p>Ciphers henchmen circled. The Time Agents grabbed their Time Tapes. Time Baby sighed, the weight of the multiverse on his doughy shoulders.</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B">I KNOW YOUR CRIMES, CIPHER. TAKING A NEW HOME WILL NOT MAKE UP FOR THE ONE YOU‚ÄôVE LOST. WHAT YOU DID TO THE COUNTLESS SOULS OF EUCLYDIA-</p>
    <p>Cipher stopped in his tracks.</p>
    <p style="color: #FFDA0F">YOU CHOOSE YOUR WORDS VERY. CAREFULLY.</p>
    <p>Ciphers henchmen murmured amongst each other, confused. They seemed to have heard conflicting stories about Bill‚Äôs past.</p>
    <p>‚ÄúYou said you liberated the people of your dimension-‚Äù</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B">LIBERATED THEM FROM THEIR BODIES!</p>
    <p style="color: #FFDA0F">DONT LISTEN TO HIM! HE‚ÄôS A BABY!<br/>HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SAY SPAGHETTI!</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B">I DO TOO</p>
    <p style="color: #FFDA0F">SAY IT</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B">...</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B">PASGHETTI</p>
    <p style="color: #FFDA0F">(TO THE TIME AGENTS) YOU‚ÄôRE REALLY GONNA FOLLOW THIS GUY?</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B; margin-top: 1rem">(SHAKING HIS HEAD IN DISTAIN) WHAT WOULD YOUR PARENTS SAY IF THEY COULD SEE WHAT YOU‚ÄôVE BECOME. WHAT WOULD SCAL-</p>
    <p style="color: #FFDA0F">ENOUGH TALK! READY TO BE KNOCKED INTO THE LITERAL ICE AGE?</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B">I DO NOT WISH TO FIGHT YOU CIPHER.</p>
    <p>Time Baby slowly began to remove his gauntlets.</p>
    <p style="color: #00FF9B">BUT A BABY‚ÄôS GOTTA DO... WHAT A BABY‚ÄôS GOTTA DO</p>
    <p>Cipher and TB lunged at each other. It was hard to see the exact nature of the time fight but there were a lot of clocks, portals, and paradoxes involved. At one point someone used nunchucks made out of two Abe Lincolns, and there was a moment where they both clipped through reality jostled the card carrier in Dennis‚Äôs backpack. But ultimately Cipher‚Äôs henchmaniacs dealt TB a devastating blow. We Time Agents were leaderless, forced to regroup back in 20712.</p>
    <p>But we knew this wasn‚Äôt over.</p>
    <p>No...</p>
    <p>It was only a matter of time</p>
