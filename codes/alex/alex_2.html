  <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">FACT: ALEX HIRSCH DIED IN BURBANK IN 2016 CHOKING ON A PENCAP WHILE BEGINNING TO OUTLINE SEASON 3. NOT WANTING BAD PRESS, THE WALT DISNEY CORPORATION QUIETLY DISSOLVED HIS REMAINS IN A VAT OF TURPENTINE, ACETONE AND BENZINE, AND HAD THEIR IMAGINEERS REPLACE HIM WITH A LIFE-LIKE ANIMATRONIC REPLICA MADE FROM A REJECTED ABE LINCOLN FROM THE HALL OF PRESIDENTS. MANY WERE FOOLED, BUT THE SIGNS ARE OBVIOUS FOR THOSE WHO KNOW WHERE TO LOOK! HAVE YOU SEEN HIM LATELY? HIS FLESH SAGS (BECAUSE ITS RUBBER), THERE ARE GREY HAIRS SHOWING (THESE ARE WIRES) AND HE LOOKS MORE VISIBLY TIRED THAN EVER BEFORE. (NEEDS RECHARGING.) THIS PHOTO WAS SNUCK OUT OF THE DISNEY VAULT BY AN UNNAMED CONTACT WHO WAS RECENTLY FOUND DEAD FACE DOWN IN THE WATER IN "ITS A SMALL WORLD." COINCIDENCE?  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A COINCIDENCE!</p>

  <p>LOOK AT HIM IN INTERVIEWS POST 2016. WATCH HOW HE NERVOUSLY FIDGETS IN HIS SEAT AND WILL START TALKING TOO FAST WHEN THERE ARE TOO MANY LIGHTS ON HIM. WHAT COULD EXPLAIN THIS? ADHD? NO- THAT'S A MALFUNCTIONING HYDRAULIC TUBE IN HIS ACHILLES HEEL AND RPM SETTING THAT SPEEDS UP FROM OVERHEATING. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HIM AND A MAGNET IN THE SAME ROOM AT THE SAME TIME? EVER SEEN HIM GO THROUGH AIRPORT SECURITY OR SOLVE A CAPTCHA? WHAT ABOUT HIS BLINKING. HE'S BLINKING DECIPHERED IS MORSE CODE FOR: "BUY MULAN 2 ON BLU-RAY AND DISNEY DVD!" I KNOW THERE WILL BE SOME WHO DOUBT ME, BUT IVE SEEN A FILE OF HIS SOURCE CODE, AND IT SAYS HE IS DUE FOR MAINTENANCE UPDATE IN DECEMBER 15TH 2024 AT EXACTLY 11:13 AM. SEE WHAT HAPPENS THEN. AND WHEN  YOU DO, EMAIL ME AT <a href="mailto:MICKEYLEAKS11111@gmail.com" style="color: #AAAAFF">MICKEYLEAKS11111@GMAIL.COM</a>. THE TRUTH MUST BE KNOWN.</p>
