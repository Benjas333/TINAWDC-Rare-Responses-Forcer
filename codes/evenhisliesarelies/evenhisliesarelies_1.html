  <p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: -2rem">As we played our first game of chess, I read Sixer’s thoughts:</p>
  <p class="font-kidwriting"><strong>“Rook to B12? No no, he’ll expect that. He’ll expect any of my gambits. Unless I do something completely, utterly random! That’ll throw him! Unless...he’s counting on random? What’s the opposite of random? Predictable! He’ll never predict that!”</strong></p>
  <p class="font-kidwriting">It never once occurred to him what my real strategy was: letting him win. Because winning made him feel special. And good god, did he want to feel special. A quick perusal of his memories showed that Sixer’s entire sense of self worth was tied up in his self image as a lone genius, causing him to ride an endless see-saw between dizzying ego and plummeting insecurity. The truth was, he was half a genius. The other half seemed to be frozen at the age of 18, still a child, totally dependent on outside praise, terrible at understanding and relating to others. A perfect pawn!</p>
  <p class="font-serif"><strong>SO FORD WAS NOTHING BUT A TOOL TO YOU?</strong></p>
  <p class="font-kidwriting">You say it like it’s a bad thing! Tools are useful! You try putting a nail in a board using your forehead and tell me how you feel about hammers after!</p>
  <p class="font-serif"><strong>SO YOU NEVER CARED ABOUT FORD?</strong></p>
  <p class="font-kidwriting">I never said that. Everyone likes having a pet human! As long as he remembers when to sit, stay, and roll over control of his entire life! If you ever find a henchman, you’ll need to do the same! Oh, but you’re too “mindful” for things like henchmen, aren’t you?</p>
