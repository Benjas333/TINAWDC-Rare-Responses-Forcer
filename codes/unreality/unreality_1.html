  <p>Here‚Äôs the big picture, slick! You‚Äôre a rapidly dissolving pile of skin and plasma, but inside that rotting meat cage is an electric spark of glittering potential. You could be EVERYTHING you‚Äôve EVER DREAMED- and DREAMING is where it STARTS!</p>
  <p>Dreams aren‚Äôt just the random static between thoughts and memories, they‚Äôre glimses into POSSIBLE REALITIES. They‚Äôre a GIFT from the perfect realm of ideas to the flawed realm of the physical. Will you accept that gift and make it manifest? Or will you miss your brief shot at immortality?</p>

  <p class="text-center w-full" style="font-size: 56px; line-height: 1.1; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -2rem">HOW TO BE IMMORTAL</p>
  <p>There are a lot of ways to cheat death! Uploading your consciousness into a robot, swapping brains with a car, putting your soul in a snowman, blah blah blah. But to become truly IMMORTAL, you have to transfer the most precious thing you have (your identity) out of your body and into the realm of IDEAS. In short: you have to create a story about yourself that‚Äôs so compelling that it‚Äôs carried virally in the minds of humanity forever, replicating your essence infinitely throughout the generations. While your flesh is temporary, your legend can carry on forever. Genetic duplication is a dying mans game, contingent on the shelf-life of meat, but memetic chrono-travel is playing the long odds.</p>
  <p>REALITY is divided into only two properties: Physical atoms, and Stories. Stories are just as real as physical reality, but they exist in a separate realm. This is why your mind is so important- it‚Äôs your one link to this world.</p>
  <p>The PHYSICAL WORLD creates and spreads stories, but the STORY WORLD controls the motives and thoughts of the Physical World. In this way, the two create each other. REALITY creates FICTION which in turn creates REALITY.</p>
  <img style="margin-top: -1rem; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; width: 320px" src="\codes\unreality\assets\image_2.png" />
  <p class="margin-top: -2rem">In the same way that your genes propogate themselves via the medium of physical meat, your identity can propogate and outlive your frail body in the MINDSCAPE. You can join me, but first you need to wake up from the dream of reality into the truth of fiction. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.</p>
